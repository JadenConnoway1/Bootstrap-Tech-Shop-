- **Welcome to Bootstrap Tech Shop,**
- Hi, my name is Jaden.
- This is the culmination of my journey through a Bootstrap course on Udemy. This project integrates lessons from various courses into a singular endeavor. While it's not a         fully-fledged website, emphasis was placed on refining UI and graphical interface design. Every logo and icon was meticulously crafted from scratch using Figma. Moreover, the     challenge was to minimize CSS usage, harnessing Bootstrap's capabilities to their fullest extent.

- Any feedback is greatly appriciated.
- Please know that this is not a Guide. Many of the things I have doen will have better ways to be done.
